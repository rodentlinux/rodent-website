# Welcome

You've reached the home of Rodent Linux â€“ the versatile root file system
generator.

Rodent Linux is a distribution that builds lean, efficient root file system
images for embedded devices, for reproducible build or test environments, for
bare-bone virtual machines, or whereever else you might need a minimal yet
complete GNU/Linux installation.

Rodent Linux comes with pre-built binary packages for a multitude of
architectures, including `x86_64`, `armv7hl`, `rpi`, `quark`, `mips`, and
`mipsel`.

A Rodent Linux image can be built as a squashfs or a compressed cpio initrd
archive, mounting a writeable in-memory overlay. This is especially handy for
embedded devices, as powerloss or hard resets will not risk corrupting the
image.

Rodent Linux features a simple, intuitive package system for you to build and
distribute your own packages, no matter if it's your application or just the
toolchain you need.
